# Part One: Lesson Three


## Writing Larger Programs

### Scope

This picks up at https://www.creativescala.org/creative-scala/programs/names.html

The problem of scope is fairly intuitive: how do we distinguish between different meanings of the same name. This problems occurs in everyday life when referring to people. There aren't that many first names, so there is a good chance you know two or more people with the same name. 

*Student Question:* how do people solve this problem? E.g. imagine you know two people with the name Zainab. How do you refer to Zainab if only one is present? What if both are present?

There are two issues:

- how many people are there with the same name: this is the issue of scope. How many names are in scope?
- terminology: aliasing or shadowing if there are two or more values with the same name in scope
- how do we distinguish different people with the same name: the solution is the same as in programming. We use a qualifier (often a surname with people).

Do the exercises in Creative Scala.


### Abstraction

You can use names to introduce abstraction. 

*Student Question:* Why do we have names? How would you refer to your family? Would you name everyone individually or would use some shorthand like "my family"? Why?

These questions show the use of abstraction: we can use names as a shorthand for referring to things. You don't have to describe someone or list out their lineage (daughter of ...) to refer to someone. You can just use their name. 

Do the exercises.


### Working Without Worksheets

You may or may not need this.


### Packages

This is just about organizing names at the top-level. 


## Substitution Model of Evaluation

People already know substitution (it is primary school level mathematics) but they don't know they know it. So walk through this slowly and do the exercises.
